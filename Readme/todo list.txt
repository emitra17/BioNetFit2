1- Fix windows compile issues/Sygwin environment  [Done]

2- Develop compile procedure [Partially Done]

3- Fix windows run time issues [done]

4- Implement random simulator to generate a random gdat file sromm the exp file for fastewr run [Done]

5- Check using nfsim by BNGL file (Converting Bngl to xml and call NFSIM)

6- Check Network generation for ODE (using BNG2.pl) [Done]

7- implement multiple files [Done]

8- Consolidate models and Free parameters [Done]

9- Develop stand alone particle test mode [only for test] [Done]

10- Fix smooth run and bootstrapping implementations for multiple files  [Done]

11- Send the right model and ref exp file to slaves to rub subparticles [Done].

12- The slave sends free parameter values based on his model that can be different than the global models
[Partially Done: implemented, but needs to be tested]

13- Modify Fitting options for multiple files. 
The slave sends the result of fitting value for each subparticle, the master should combine them. 
Implement the function update_fitCalcs();


14- modify Swarm::processParamsPSO() 
	The params order is based on free parameters in the corresonding model, reorder based on the global list

15-	modifty function order_params()
	The params order is based on free parameters in the corresonding model, reorder based on the global list

16- modify generateBestFitModel: adjust paramSet based on the model
	
	


14- Simulated anealing synchronous mode is not develped.

15-Test resume mode for multiple files

16-Test actual simulators

17-Implement Asynchronous mode for Simulated Anealing

18-Test All optimization methods

19-Check cluster operation
