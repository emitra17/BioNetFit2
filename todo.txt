Merge the fits from each subparticle

Setting.hh and GenFit2.hh

uncoment Ver2 to go to previous version

add comments for each change I make



the -h option changed totally




GenFit2.hh



mid (model id) (01010101)

subparid (12345678)

Utils.hh convert the numbers of the particles

doswarm (swarm size is now the number subparticles)

nSubPar variables


runSSA needs implamation (but not highest priority)


use the
runSGA()


Swarm.hh -> set exp path, get exp (file name)


update_cur_particle_part (make sure the particles are finished when subparticles from that one is finished)


model now is a vector (pointer before)



consolidate models, remove the reduntant free parameters, generates vector of strings of al free parameters, its a vector of map objects


runGeneration
check resources available, launches subparticles, until all of the subparticles are finished



Setting.hh STANDALONE_PARTICLE.... uncoment, if you want debug test info


Swarm.cpp
keep TEST_SIMULATOR active

work with subpartcle ids


change simulator -> just go to the config file



checkMasterMessage() in Swarm.cpp
review the subparticles, we need to work only with subpar now.

sconfig files, has the model information

[1:1-0]
subparticle:pardicle-model


running particles multiple times and taking averages
runningSubParticleIteration -> smooth fit



The output shows
m2	k2 k3
m1      k1 k3
global Fit k1 k2 l3

the parameters are not aligned, align them to the global list (with all free parameters)

subparticleCurrParamSets stores 
 it is implemented for the GA

implement for all the others

finish fit

killAllParticles change to subparticles

fitCalc for one subparticle
outputs result for one subparticle

define fir_weights=1,2
one weight per model

Add fit model 1, fit model 2, fit all


take a look 

bngl to xml?
